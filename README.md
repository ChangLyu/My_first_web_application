# My_first_web_application

This is my first web application, which can create new contact, edit, delete contacts.
JSP and HTML are used to create the web pages and build connection to servlet. 
Different servlet are created to realize different function, such as edting and deleting. A class called Contacts are created. 
Hibernate is used to build the mapping between the object and the relational table in the database.
